# Life Insurance Voice Agent SOE sample

This sample shows how a Service Orchestration Engine can be used with an external service. It should be used in conjunction with the video series available on IBM Support TV's YouTube channel here [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4RxtD-BL5s7OfjM9T4WgfyDF74BDPoE).

These files can be used with the part three video to build your own life insurance service :

WCS_LifeinsuranceQuote.json : Watson Conversation workspace containing the life insurance conversation.

NodeRED_Starter.json : Starter NodeRED flow with basic SOE

NodeRED_Finished.json : Completed NodeRED flow as at the end of the video

NodeRED_Pricing.json : Simple pricing service that can be called from SOE flow to obtain a quotation.
